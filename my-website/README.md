## Uploading the `site.zip` File

To upload the `site.zip` file from your local drive to your codespace, follow these steps:

1. **Open your terminal** in the codespace.

2. **Use the `scp` command** to securely copy the file from your local machine to the codespace. Run the following command, replacing `<your-codespace-username>` and `<your-codespace-ip>` with your actual codespace username and IP address:

   ```
   scp /Users/a1466/Downloads/site.zip <your-codespace-username>@<your-codespace-ip>:~/my-website/
   ```

3. **Navigate to the project directory** in your codespace:

   ```
   cd ~/my-website
   ```

4. **Unzip the file** to extract its contents:

   ```
   unzip site.zip
   ```

5. **Verify the project structure** to ensure all files are in place:

   ```
   tree
   ```

Now, your project should be set up with the `site.zip` contents extracted into the `my-website` directory.
